# website

You'll need to make a folder called ```config``` then make a ```config.json``` file with the following contents:
```
{
  "clientId": "",
  "clientSecret": "",
  "port": "80" (you can change this!)
}
```

Of course enter your client secret and client id into those fields, they are used for authentication for the website
